- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TywrapStudios
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Modding Minecraft and playing it
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot of stuff related to Minecraft Fabric and developing Discord Bots using discord.py
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kcm8scfCwK) and then maybe just DM me on Discord, anything works! For like, business related stuff there's also `info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com`!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: any idrc :D
